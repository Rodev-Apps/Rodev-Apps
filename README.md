# Welcome to my portal

## Overview
The advent of Web Development has changed the landscape of communication and interaction in our society today. We now live in a world whose engine having been transformed from analog to digital is now moving at lightning speed. Although the days of sending handwritten postcards, letters, and application forms are still relatively fresh in our minds, it's beginning to feel like that was over a century ago. In keeping with this trend, herein is an attempt to showcase my work, digitize my CV, and tap into the power of Social Media through GitHub and the potential that it brings.

## Purpose
Having recently transformed my skills from Hardware to Software Engineering, this portal is set up to provide an easy but effective way to be discovered by potential clients who would be on the lookout for my skillset. Its diversity, richness, and simplicity of access of I believe creates an irresistible appeal to like-minded tech employers and Web Developers alike. I hope that this digital representation of my portfolio, skills, qualifications, and experience meeting your satisfaction as you peruse through its contents. Although this is just a tip of the iceberg, I am quietly confident that it will go some way to convince any interested part of the depth of talent, creativity, passion, and hard work which just happens to be my core strengths.
