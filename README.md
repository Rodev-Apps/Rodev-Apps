# Welcome to my portal

## Overview
The advent of Web Development has changed the landscape of communication and interaction in our society today. We now live in a world whose engine having been transformed from analog to digital is now moving at lightning speed. Although the days of sending handwritten postcards, letters, and application forms are still relatively fresh in our minds, it's beginning to feel like that was over a century ago. In keeping with this trend, herein is an attempt to showcase my work, digitize my CV, and tap into the power of Social Media through GitHub and the potential that it brings.

## Purpose
Having recently transitioned from Hardware to Software Engineering, I am currently honing my skills to provide exceptional service in this area. This portal was created to provide an easy but effective way to reach potential clients on the lookout for my skillset. Its diversity, richness, and simplicity of access, I believe creates an irresistible appeal to like-minded tech entrepreneurs, managers, and web developers alike. I hope that this digital representation of my portfolio, skills, qualifications, and experience meets your satisfaction as you peruse through its contents. Although this is just the tip of the iceberg, I am quietly confident that it will go some way to convince any interested part of the depth of talent, creativity, passion, and hard work which just happens to be my core strengths.
